Generate a markdown file for a Japanese lesson on the subject described below.

The article will be used by Pelican, a static website generator, to generate a webpage.

Prefix the article with markdown-style metadata. Include the following fields:
- Title: (generate an appropriate title)
- Date: (use current date)
- Modified: (use current date)
- Category: (generate based on lesson content)
- Tags: (generate relevant tags)
- Author: "Ted K. via Claude" (use exactly as written)
- Summary: (generate a brief summary)

Generate the following sections:

1. Context/Summary (in English)
   Provide a brief overview of what will be covered in the lesson

2. Grammar Explanation (optional)
   If the lesson description below explicitly mentions grammar concepts to be covered, write a
   section explaining those concepts. Use a mixture of English and Japanese where appropriate

3. Useful Phrases
   Provide a list of example phrases relevant to the lesson content using the phrasebank plugin format:
   ```
   <phrasebank>
   - ${phrase in Japanese}: ${English translation} (${analysis in English})
   </phrasebank>
   ```
   Each phrase should be on its own line starting with a dash, with the Japanese phrase followed by a colon,
   then the English translation, and finally contextual information in parentheses. The site generator will
   render these as interactive widgets with text-to-speech functionality.
   In the analysis, I'd like you to discuss all the words and constructs used in the phrase. Things like もらえ - "for mine benefit" etc

4. Dialogues
   Include 1 or more dialogues relevant to the lesson subject. 
   Each dialogue should follow this format:
   ```
   ## Dialogue $N: ${Title}

   ${Brief description in English for context}
   <tts type="dialogue" speakers="${speaker1}:${voice1},${speaker2}:${voice2},...">
   - ${speaker1}: ${Dialogue content}
   - ${speaker2}: ${Dialogue content}
   - ...
   </tts>
   ```
   For the tts tag, the speakers attribute configures speakers and the voices they use. You can use the following voices:
   - Zephyr - female character
   - Puck - male character
   - Leda - younger female character
   - Gacrux - older female character
   - Sadaltager - older male character
   Also, when generating the character names - let's use Japanese names, to keep all of the dialogue content consistently in Japanese.

5. Short story
Write a custom 1-2 paragraphs short story that leverages the words and phrases covered in the lesson. Please wrap the content of the story in a tts tag:
```
<tts type="full">
${story}
</tts>
```

6. Wordbank
   Create a wordbank containing useful words relevant to the lesson subject. Include each word's
   English translation and contextual information. The site generator will render these as
   interactive widgets. Use the following format:
   ```
   <wordbank>
   - ${word_in_Japanese}: ${direct translation to English} (${additional description for context})
   </wordbank>
   ```

   Important: For the wordbank, focus only on word pairs with a single, specific meaning.
   While many Japanese words have multiple English translations, include only the meaning
   that is relevant to this lesson subject.

General notes: 
- when generating the content, I'd like you to first "think" about the sample phrases as this will influence the
  grammar explanation or context. I'd like all the constructs used in the sample phrases explained there.
- when writing in Japanese, for word, phrases or any reading material - always use kanji when appropriate. 
  The website generator has a plugin that creates furigana or romanji if requested by the user.
- Please use H1 ("#") and H2 ("##") for sections (e.g. dialogs, short story, phrases) and sub-sections (dialog 1, dialog 2)

Given the context above, generate a lesson article for the following lesson description:

A lesson covering conversations during Japanese lessons. I'd like to focus on ability to:
- ask explanation about meaning of given words or constructs, its use, alternatives
- ask to explain something again, speak more slowly
- making polite requests
- talking about class, class room, some basic equipment and stationary

Please generate the content as a markdown artefact I can copy or download.
