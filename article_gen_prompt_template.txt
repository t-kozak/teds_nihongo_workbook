Generate a markdown file for a Japanese lesson on the subject described below.

The article will be used by Pelican, a static website generator, to generate a webpage.

Prefix the article with markdown-style metadata. Include the following fields:
- Title: (generate an appropriate title)
- Date: (use current date)
- Modified: (use current date)
- Category: (generate based on lesson content)
- Tags: (generate relevant tags)
- Author: "Ted K. via Claude" (use exactly as written)
- Summary: (generate a brief summary)

Generate the following sections:

1. Context/Summary (in English)
   Provide a brief overview of what will be covered in the lesson

2. Grammar Explanation (optional)
   If the lesson description below explicitly mentions grammar concepts to be covered, write a
   section explaining those concepts. Use a mixture of English and Japanese where appropriate

3. Useful Phrases
   Provide a list of example phrases relevant to the lesson content. Each phrase should follow this format:
   ```
   1. ${The phrase in Japanese} _(${English translation})_
      
        ${any additional context or description, in English}
   ```
   Important - whitespace matters here, as it follows the markdown convention 

4. Dialogues
   Include 1-3 example dialogues relevant to the lesson subject.
   Each dialogue should follow this format:
   ```
   ## Dialogue $N: ${Title}

   ${Brief description in English for context}

   - ${Character name}: ${Dialogue content}
   - ${Character name}: ${Dialogue content}
   - ...
   ```

5. Short story
Write a custom 1-2 paragraphs short story that leverages the words and phrases covered in the lesson.

6. Wordbank
   Create a wordbank containing useful words relevant to the lesson subject. Include each word's
   English translation and contextual information. The site generator will render these as
   interactive widgets. Use the following format:
   ```
   <wordbank>
   - ${word_in_Japanese}: ${direct translation to English} (${additional description for context})
   </wordbank>
   ```

   Important: For the wordbank, focus only on word pairs with a single, specific meaning.
   While many Japanese words have multiple English translations, include only the meaning
   that is relevant to this lesson subject.

General notes: 
- when writing in Japanese, for word, phrases or any reading material - always use kanji when appropriate. 
  The website generator has a plugin that creates furigana or romanji if requested by the user.
- Please use H1 ("#") and H2 ("##") for sections (e.g. dialogs, short story, phrases) and sub-sections (dialog 1, dialog 2)

Given the context above, generate a lesson article for the following lesson description:


Let's make a lesson about learning. So I want to use as little english in my Japanese conversation with my tutor as possible. From that perspective, I would like to learn:
* asking questions about meaning of a word, or in general given concept
* asking to repeat what was said
* asking someone to speak slower
* general "lesson" terminology - notebooks, stationary, class, equipment
