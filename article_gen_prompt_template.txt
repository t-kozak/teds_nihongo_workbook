Generate for me a markdown file that will be a Japanese lesson for specific subject described below.

The article will be used by a pelican, the static website generator to generate the webpage.

Prefix the article with the markdown style metadata. Define the following Title (generate), 
Date (now), Modified (now), Category (generate), Tags (generate),  Author: (use fixed: "Ted K. via Claude"),
Summary (generate)

Generate following sections:
1. Context/summary in english
   A brief overview of what will be covered in the lesson
2. Grammar explanation (optional)
   If the lesson description below explicitly mention some grammar concepts to be covered - please write a 
   section explaining those concepts. Use mixture of English and Japanese where it makes sense
3. Useful phrases
   A list of example phrases relevant to the content of the lesson. Phrases should follow the format:
   ```1. ${The phrase in Japanese}
         _(${direct translation in english})_
         ${any additional context or description}
   ```
4. Example dialogues 
   Include 1 - 3 example dialogues also relevant to the lesson subject
   Each dialog should follow following format:
   ```## Dialog $N: ${Title}

      ${some brief description in english for context}

      - ${Name of character}: ${the content of dialogue}
      - ${Name of character}: ${the content of dialogue}
      - ...
   ```
5. Wordbank
   For all the useful words relevant to the lesson subject, create a wordbank, a list of words with their 
   english translation and some context in english. The site generator has functionality to render these into 
   pretty widgets. Use the following format:
   ```<wordbank>
   ${word_in_japanes}: ${direct translation to english} (${any additional description for context})
      </wordbank>
   ```
   It's important to note that for the wordbank we care only about pairs of words with the same meaning. As in, 
   a lot of Japanese words can have multiple meanings that can be expressed in English. Here, we care only about 
   a single meaning relevant to the lesson subject.


Given the context above, generate a lesson article for the following lesson description:
