# Lesson overview

In Engligh, provide a brief overview of what will be covered in the lesson.

# Preparation

## Grammar Explanation

If the lesson description below explicitly mentions grammar concepts to be covered, write a
section explaining those concepts. Use a mixture of English and Japanese where appropriate

## Useful Phrases

Provide a list of example phrases relevant to the lesson content using the phrasebank plugin format:
```
<phrasebank>
- ${phrase in Japanese}: ${English translation} (${analysis in English})
</phrasebank>
```
Each phrase should be on its own line starting with a dash, with the Japanese phrase followed by a colon,
then the English translation, and finally contextual information in parentheses. The site generator will
render these as interactive widgets with text-to-speech functionality.
In the analysis, I'd like you to discuss all the words and constructs used in the phrase. 
Things like もらえ - "for mine benefit" etc.

General notes: 
- when generating the content, first "think" about the sample phrases as this will influence the
  grammar explanation or context. All the constructs used in the sample phrases explained there.
- when writing in Japanese, for word, phrases or any reading material - always use kanji when appropriate. 
  The website generator has a plugin that creates furigana or romanji if requested by the user.
