Summary: Introduction to my Japanese language learning journey and workbook

# Welcome to Ted's 日本語 Workbook

Welcome to my Japanese language learning journey!

## About This Site

This workbook is a collection of Japanese language learning materials, exercises, and notes. I'm documenting my progress as I study 日本語 (Nihongo - Japanese).

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on:

- **Hiragana** (ひらがな) - The basic Japanese phonetic writing system
- **Basic Vocabulary** - Common words and phrases for everyday conversation
- **Grammar Fundamentals** - Understanding Japanese sentence structure

## Recent Progress

### Hiragana Practice

I've been practicing writing and reading hiragana characters. Here are some basics:

- あ (a) - The first character
- い (i) - The second character
- う (u) - The third character
- え (e) - The fourth character
- お (o) - The fifth character

### First Words

Some simple words I've learned:

- こんにちは (Konnichiwa) - Hello
- ありがとう (Arigatou) - Thank you
- さようなら (Sayounara) - Goodbye

## Next Steps

- Complete all hiragana characters
- Start learning katakana (カタカナ)
- Build a vocabulary list of 100 common words
- Practice basic sentence patterns
